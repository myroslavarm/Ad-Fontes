# Ad-Fontes
an end-of-term Algorithms and Data Structures / Linear ALgebra project

The goal of this project is to make a working Bees Algorithm implementation, as well as provide an analysis and data visualisation based on the data provided. The main source used is a paper on the Bees Algorithm by D.T. Pham *et al*., [The Bees Algorithm â€“ A Novel Tool for Complex Optimisation
Problems](https://svn-d1.mpi-inf.mpg.de/AG1/MultiCoreLab/papers/Pham06%20-%20The%20Bee%20Algorithm.pdf).
